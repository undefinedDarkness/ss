#  ðŸš€ Super switcher  
A simple quick menu application, built atop gtk in lua.  
Heavily inspired by [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) and [nvim telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim), they are great projects that are in a much more finished state  
than this mess..  
  
## ðŸŽ¨ Customization  
You can use the GTK Debugger to get class names and modify their appearance in app.css  
  
### How to use the GTK Debugger  
```  
GTK_DEBUG=interactive lua init.lua  
```  
  
## Modifying Functionality / Behaviour
You will need to know lua :)   
There is no customization outside of the source code.  
You can search for places you might want to change stuff with `grep -r 'CHANGE' .`  
  
## Installation & Usage  
```  
git clone https://github.com/undefinedDarkness/ss.git  
cd ss  
lua init.lua  
```  
  
## State of Development  
I would not consider it usable as of right now..  
And its full of performance issues everywhere - This has improved now somewhat
  
### TODO  
- Proper capturing of the keyboard - has improved   
- A file finder source âœ”  
- A rip grep source  âœ”  
- Fuzzy matching using https://github.com/swarn/fzy-lua âœ”  
- A unit conversion source  
- Dmenu mode  âœ”   
- Add icon support to dmenu mode  
- Better documentation  
- More advanced results than just icon / text / callback  - Support exists but need to implement for some of the backends  
- A configuration system - Might not implement not sure 
- File preview support for the file finder
`grep -r 'TODO' .`  
  
## Documentation  
  
### ðŸ“‚ File finder source  
Search for files from your home directory,  
only works when you use a bang since   
it would be too slow to use normally  
Bang: `!f`  
  
### Applications  
Search for any installed applications, that were   
installed with a [.desktop](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/desktop_entries) file.  
  
### Math   
Any queries in the form of `n <operation> n =` will try to be solved by lua,  
and the result will become an item,  
Bang: `!m` - The equal sign shouldnt be there when using the bang  
  
* Bangs are used as a prefix to your query to target a specific source.  
Eg: `!f init.lua` will try using the file finder source  
  
### Credits  
- [Fzy-Lua](https://github.com/swarn/fzy-lua) for implements fuzzy finding so I don't have to :)  
- [No37](https://github.com/Nooo37) for giving lots of help and feedback on the project
